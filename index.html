            <h2>Why London?</h2>
            <h3>London, historical, cultural and economic megacity</h3>
            <p>
              London's history spans over two millennia, from its Roman founding
              as Londinium in 43 AD to its current status as a global capital.
              Initially a settlement on the River Thames, it was later
              influenced by Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, and Normans. The city
              experienced growth, plague, fire, and the rise and fall of the
              British Empire, ultimately becoming a megacity and one of the most
              famous cities in the world.
            </p>

            <p>
              Today, London is a vibrant metropolis, a major economic,
              transportation, and cultural hub, and a testament to its
              resilience and enduring legacy. Its history is woven into the
              fabric of its streets, buildings, and institutions, making it a
              city with a rich past and a dynamic present.

                <p>
                  The Tower of London, officially His Majesty's Royal Palace and
                  Fortress of the Tower of London, is a historic citadel and
                  castle on the north bank of the River Thames in central
                  London. Throughout its long history, it was a secure fortress,
                  a royal palace, and an infamous prison. Kings and queens
                  demonstrated their power from here, shaping society and
                  influencing our world.

                <p>
                  There is a rich history of spies, political games and treason
                  in the Tower of London and it was fun to learn about it all
                  under a watchful eye of the Tower's Ravens.

              Hello! My name is Filipa and I've always been interested in London
              and it's history. Recently I finally got the opportunity to travel
              to London and I was happy to see the popular sights, visit museums
              and try out many different cuisines. I am very happy to have
              visited London and I am already planning my next visit. I created
              this page as part of a project for SheCodes Responsive to develop
              my coding skills.
